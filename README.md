# ros_ultrascale
ROS(robot operating system) based on xilinx ultrascale+

30.08.2018 Im trying to understand how ros works. I will install kinetic on ARM A53 and build a ros master on it.
But its still a problem for me, how to get access to on-board memory and another ARM A53 within ros architecture
